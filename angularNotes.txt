Introduction to Angular
Welcome to the world of Angular! Angular is a powerful framework for building interactive web applications. It allows developers to create dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) that provide a smooth user experience. With Angular, you can build applications that are not only efficient but also maintainable and scalable.
Angular is a javascript framework ( a platform for developing softwares) that allows us to create single page applications (SPAs)
Key Concepts of Angular
Components: 
An angular application is made of components , a component is a single piece of user interface 
The building blocks of Angular applications. Each component controls a part of the user interface (UI) and consists of an HTML template, a CSS style, and a TypeScript class.
Modules: Angular applications are modular. A module is a container for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities.
Services: These are used to share data and functionality across components. Services are typically used for data fetching, logging, or any business logic.
Routing: Angular provides a powerful routing mechanism that allows you to navigate between different views or components in your application.
Installation Guide
To get started with Angular, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here’s a step-by-step guide:
Install Node.js: Angular requires Node.js to run. You can download it from Node.js official website. Make sure to install the LTS version.
Install Angular CLI: The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that helps you create and manage Angular applications. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
javascript


npm install -g @angular/cli
This command installs the Angular CLI globally on your system.
Create a New Angular Project: Once the CLI is installed, you can create a new Angular project by running
ng new my-first-app

Replace my-first-app with your desired project name. This command will create a new directory with all the necessary files for your Angular application.
Navigate to Your Project Directory: Change into your project directory:
javascript


cd my-first-app
Run the Application: Start the development server by running:
javascript


ng serve
This command compiles your application and serves it locally. You can view your application by navigating to http://localhost:4200 in your web browser.
Building Your First Component
Now that you have your Angular application set up, let’s create a simple component:
Generate a New Component: Use the Angular CLI to generate a new component called hello-world:
javascript


ng generate component hello-world
This command creates a new folder with the component files in the src/app directory.
Modify the Component: Open the hello-world.component.ts file and modify it to display a simple message:
typescript

Understanding Angular Components and Views
Angular applications are built using components, and each component controls a part of the UI. Let's break down the key concepts in simple terms.

1. Angular Creates a New Instance for Each Matching Element
When Angular sees an HTML element that matches a component’s selector, it creates an instance of that component and inserts its template into the page.

Example:

<app-hello></app-hello>
<app-hello></app-hello>
If app-hello is a component, Angular creates two separate instances of it, each managing its own data.

2. What is the Host Element?
The host element is the actual HTML element in the DOM where the component is placed.

Example:

@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello',
  template: `<p>Hello, Angular!</p>`
})
export class HelloComponent {}
When you use <app-hello></app-hello> in your HTML, it becomes the host element, and Angular places the template’s content inside it.

Rendered in the DOM:


<app-hello>
  <p>Hello, Angular!</p>
</app-hello>
Here, <app-hello> is the host element, and <p>Hello, Angular!</p> is the component’s template.

3. What is a Component’s View?
The view of a component is the DOM structure generated based on its template.

If a component has a template, its view is the rendered HTML inside the host element.
If the template updates (e.g., due to data changes), the view also updates.
Example with Dynamic Data:

typescript

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user',
  template: `<p>Welcome, {{ name }}!</p>`
})
export class UserComponent {
  name = 'Urbanus';
}

<app-user>
  <p>Welcome, Urbanus!</p>
</app-user>
If name changes to "Kioko", the view updates to:

<app-user>
  <p>Welcome, Kioko!</p>
</app-user>
Angular automatically updates the view when data changes.

Imports in the @Component decorator
To use a component, directive, or pipe, you must add it to the imports array in the @Component decorator:
example;

import {ProfilePhoto} from './profile-photo';
@Component({
  // Import the `ProfilePhoto` component in
  // order to use it in this component's template.
  imports: [ProfilePhoto],
  /* ... */
})

export class UserProfile { }
By default, Angular components are standalone, meaning that you can directly add them to the imports array of other components. Components created with an earlier version of Angular may instead specify standalone: false in their @Component decorator. For these components, you instead import the NgModule in which the component is defined.
IMPORTANT: In Angular versions before 19.0.0, the standalone option defaults to false.

4. The Component Tree: Your App is a Tree of Components
In Angular, your application is structured as a tree of components.

The root component (e.g., AppComponent) contains child components.
Child components can have their own child components, forming a hierarchical tree.
Example:

<app-root>
  <app-header></app-header>
  <app-sidebar></app-sidebar>
  <app-content>
    <app-article></app-article>
    <app-comments></app-comments>
  </app-content>
</app-root>
📌 Here:

<app-root> is the main/root component.
<app-header>, <app-sidebar>, and <app-content> are child components.
<app-article> and <app-comments> are nested inside <app-content>.
This component-based architecture helps keep the code modular and reusable.

You show a component by creating a matching HTML element in the template of other components:
@Component({
  selector: 'profile-photo',
})
export class ProfilePhoto { }
@Component({
  imports: [ProfilePhoto],
  template: `<profile-photo />`//the imported element is rendered here
})
export class UserProfile { }
Angular creates an instance of the component for every matching HTML element it encounters. The DOM element that matches a component's selector is referred to as that component's host element. The contents of a component's template are rendered inside its host element.

The DOM rendered by a component, corresponding to that component's template, is called that component's view.

In composing components in this way, you can think of your Angular application as a tree of components.
Every component defines a CSS selector that determines how the component is used:
You use a component by creating a matching HTML element in the templates of other components:
Angular matches selectors statically at compile-time. Changing the DOM at run-time, either via Angular bindings or with DOM APIs, does not affect the components rendered.

An element can match exactly one component selector. If multiple component selectors match a single element, Angular reports an error.

Component selectors are case-sensitive.
When Angular compiles your component,styles are emitted with your component's JavaScript output. This means that component styles participate in the JavaScript module system. When you render an Angular component, the framework automatically includes its associated styles, even when lazy-loading a component.
Conclusion
✅ Angular creates a new instance of a component for each matching element in the HTML.
✅ The host element is the actual DOM element where the component's content is rendered.
✅ The view of a component is the rendered HTML inside the host element.
✅ An Angular application is structured as a tree of components, making it modular and easy to maintain.

NB: In app.component.spec.ts- we write unit test code

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello-world',
  template: `<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`,
  styles: []
})
export class HelloWorldComponent {}
Use the Component: To display your new component, open the app.component.html file and add the following line:



<app-hello-world></app-hello-world>
View Your Changes: Save your changes and go back to your browser. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.

Data Binding in Angular
Data binding in Angular is a powerful feature that establishes a connection between the application's data (model) and the user interface (view). It allows developers to synchronize data between the component and the DOM, ensuring that changes in one are automatically reflected in the other. This capability enhances the interactivity and responsiveness of web applications.
Types of Data Binding
Interpolation:
Interpolation is a one-way data binding technique that allows you to display component properties in the template. It uses double curly braces {{ }} to bind data from the component to the view.
Example:



<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
In this example, the value of the title property from the component will be displayed in the <h1> tag.
Property Binding:
Property binding allows you to bind the properties of HTML elements to component properties. This is done using square brackets [ ].
Example:



<img [src]="imageUrl">
Here, the src attribute of the <img> tag is bound to the imageUrl property in the component.
Event Binding:
Event binding enables you to listen for events (like clicks, key presses, etc.) and execute methods in the component when those events occur. This is done using parentheses ( ).
Example:
html


<button (click)="onClick()">Click Me</button>
In this case, when the button is clicked, the onClick() method in the component will be executed.
Two-Way Data Binding:
Two-way data binding combines property binding and event binding, allowing for a two-way synchronization between the model and the view. This is commonly used with forms and is achieved using the [(ngModel)] syntax.
Example:
html


<input [(ngModel)]="username">
Here, changes to the input field will update the username property in the component, and any changes to username will update the input field.
Benefits of Data Binding
Automatic Synchronization: Data binding ensures that the model and view are always in sync, reducing the need for manual DOM manipulation.
Improved Readability: It makes the code cleaner and easier to understand by separating the logic from the presentation.
Enhanced User Experience: Users see real-time updates in the UI as they interact with the application, leading to a more dynamic experience.
In summary, data binding in Angular is a fundamental concept that facilitates the interaction between the application's data and the user interface, making it easier to build responsive and interactive web applications.


Data binding : data binding is the communucation between component class and its corresponding html template (flow of data  between component class and the html template )
In Angular, when you use let i = index inside *ngFor, the index is a special built-in variable that Angular provides.

How Does Angular Determine the Index?
The index starts at 0 by default.

It increments by 1 for each subsequent item in the list.

Example Usage

<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let todoItem of inputText; let i = index">
    <span>✅ {{ i + 1 }}. {{ todoItem }}</span>
    <span (click)="deleteTodo(i)" style="cursor: pointer;">❌</span>
  </li>
</ul>
What Happens Here?
If inputText = ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3'], Angular will render:

Index 0 → Task 1

Index 1 → Task 2

Index 2 → Task 3

Clicking the ❌ removes the corresponding item because deleteTodo(i) receives the correct index.

Delete Function in TypeScript

deleteTodo(index: number) {
  this.inputText.splice(index, 1);
}
This ensures that the correct item is removed when the ❌ is clicked.

direcives in Angular
[ngStyle] directive:ngStyle is an attribute directive which allows you to add CSS styles dynamically on a DOM element.
[ngClass] :used to remove or add classes dynamically on a DOM element based on a ts expression

Overview of Directives in Angular
Directives in Angular are a powerful feature that allows developers to extend HTML by adding custom behaviors to DOM elements or creating new HTML elements. They play a crucial role in Angular's declarative approach to building user interfaces, enabling the modification and enhancement of the behavior of elements within the application 
 
.
Types of Directives
There are several types of directives in Angular, primarily categorized into:
Attribute Directives: These are used to change the appearance or behavior of an existing element. They can modify the DOM properties or styles of the elements they are applied to 
 
.
Structural Directives: These directives alter the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements. Common examples include *ngIf and *ngFor, which conditionally include or repeat elements in the DOM.
Purpose and Functionality
Directives are essentially classes that Angular uses to add functionality to elements in the DOM. When a directive is found in the DOM, the Angular compiler executes its associated function, allowing developers to enhance the HTML syntax with new capabilities 
 
. This extensibility is what makes Angular a robust framework for building both mobile and desktop web applications 
.
Passing data from a child component to a parent component in Angular is done using the @Output decorator along with an EventEmitter. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Create the Child Component
Let’s say we have a ChildComponent that sends data to the parent.

Run the following command to generate the child component:



ng generate component child
Step 2: Define an @Output Property in the Child Component
Inside child.component.ts, define an @Output property with an EventEmitter.

import { Component, EventEmitter, Output } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  templateUrl: './child.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./child.component.css']
})
export class ChildComponent {
  // Define an event emitter to send data to parent
  @Output() sendData = new EventEmitter<string>();

  sendMessage() {
    this.sendData.emit('Hello from Child Component!');
  }
}
Step 3: Trigger the Event in the Child Component Template
Inside child.component.html, add a button that will trigger the sendMessage() method.


<button (click)="sendMessage()">Send Message to Parent</button>
Step 4: Capture the Data in the Parent Component
In parent.component.html, include the child component and listen for the emitted event.


<app-child (sendData)="receiveMessage($event)"></app-child>
<p>Message from Child: {{ message }}</p>
Step 5: Define the Event Handler in the Parent Component
In parent.component.ts, define the receiveMessage method to capture the data.


import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-parent',
  templateUrl: './parent.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./parent.component.css']
})
export class ParentComponent {
  message: string = '';

  receiveMessage(data: string) {
    this.message = data;
  }
}
Final Output
When you click the "Send Message to Parent" button in the child component, the parent component will receive and display the message.

Complete Guide to Angular Pipes
What Are Angular Pipes?
In Angular, pipes are a powerful way to transform data before displaying it in the view. They allow you to manipulate the output of data in the template without changing the underlying data itself.

Pipes are used for tasks like formatting dates, converting text to uppercase, filtering arrays, or transforming complex data objects.

Types of Pipes
Built-in Pipes

Custom Pipes

1. Built-in Pipes in Angular
Angular provides several built-in pipes that can be used out-of-the-box. They include:

1.1. Common Built-in Pipes:
DatePipe: Formats dates according to a given format.


{{ currentDate | date:'short' }}
UpperCasePipe / LowerCasePipe: Converts text to uppercase or lowercase.


{{ 'angular' | uppercase }}  <!-- Result: ANGULAR -->
{{ 'angular' | lowercase }}  <!-- Result: angular -->
CurrencyPipe: Formats numbers as currency.


{{ 1234.56 | currency:'USD' }} <!-- Result: $1,234.56 -->
DecimalPipe: Formats numbers to a specific number of decimal places.


{{ 3.14159 | number:'1.1-2' }}  <!-- Result: 3.14 -->
PercentPipe: Formats numbers as percentages.


{{ 0.25 | percent }}  <!-- Result: 25% -->
JsonPipe: Converts an object into a JSON string (useful for debugging).


{{ object | json }}
SlicePipe: Extracts a subset of an array or string.


{{ 'Angular Pipes' | slice:0:6 }}  <!-- Result: Angul -->
AsyncPipe: Unwraps values from an observable or a promise.

<div *ngIf="data$ | async as data">
  {{ data }}
</div>
1.2. Importing Built-In Pipes
For built-in pipes to work in Angular, the CommonModule must be imported in the module where you're using them.

import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

@NgModule({
  imports: [CommonModule],
  declarations: [SomeComponent],
})
export class SomeModule {}
2. Custom Pipes
Custom pipes allow you to transform data in a more specialized way according to your application's needs. You can create custom pipes for any specific transformation you need.

2.1. Creating a Custom Pipe
To create a custom pipe:

Generate the Pipe: You can generate a pipe using Angular CLI.

ng generate pipe reverse
Implement the Custom Pipe:

In the generated pipe file (e.g., reverse.pipe.ts), you will implement your custom logic by implementing the PipeTransform interface.

Example: A custom pipe that reverses a string.


import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'reverse'
})
export class ReversePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    return value.split('').reverse().join('');
  }
}
Use the Custom Pipe in Templates:

After declaring the custom pipe in your module, you can use it in your templates.

Example:


{{ 'Angular' | reverse }}  <!-- Result: ralugnA -->
2.2. Declaring and Exporting Custom Pipes
Custom pipes need to be declared in the module's declarations array. If you want to reuse the pipe in other modules, you must export it.


@NgModule({
  declarations: [ReversePipe],  // Declare your custom pipe
  exports: [ReversePipe]        // Export it for use in other modules
})
export class SharedModule {}
Now, you can import the SharedModule in any module where you want to use the ReversePipe.


import { SharedModule } from './shared/shared.module';

@NgModule({
  imports: [SharedModule]  // Import shared module to use the custom pipe
})
export class SomeModule {}
3. Pipe Parameters
Many pipes, including custom ones, can accept arguments or parameters to make them more flexible.

3.1. Built-in Pipes with Parameters:
DatePipe: Allows specifying the format of the date.

{{ currentDate | date:'fullDate' }}  <!-- Result: Monday, January 1, 2024 -->
CurrencyPipe: Can specify the currency symbol and locale.


{{ 1234.56 | currency:'EUR':'symbol' }}  <!-- Result: €1,234.56 -->
3.2. Custom Pipe with Parameters:
Custom pipes can also accept parameters. For example, let's modify the ReversePipe to take an optional parameter to determine whether to reverse only part of the string.


@Pipe({
  name: 'reverse'
})
export class ReversePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string, reverse: boolean = true): string {
    return reverse ? value.split('').reverse().join('') : value;
  }
}
Usage with parameter:

{{ 'Angular' | reverse:true }}  <!-- Result: ralugnA -->
{{ 'Angular' | reverse:false }} <!-- Result: Angular -->
4. Pure vs Impure Pipes
4.1. Pure Pipes
By default, pipes in Angular are pure. This means they are only re-executed when the input data changes (detected by Angular's change detection).

4.2. Impure Pipes
If your pipe requires re-evaluation even if the input data doesn't change (for example, when an object or array changes but the reference doesn't), you can make the pipe impure by setting the pure property to false in the pipe's metadata.


@Pipe({
  name: 'impureReverse',
  pure: false
})
export class ImpureReversePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: any): any {
    return value;
  }
}
However, keep in mind that impure pipes are less efficient, as they are evaluated more often than pure pipes.

5. Optimizing Pipe Performance
When using pipes, especially custom pipes, performance can be an issue if the pipe does not track the changes in the input data efficiently. Here's how to optimize pipes:

Use pure pipes wherever possible.

Avoid doing heavy calculations inside pipes. Move complex logic to components or services if necessary.

6. Using Pipes in Angular Forms
You can also use pipes with Angular Forms. For example, in a form, you may want to apply a pipe to transform the user input.

Example (using uppercase pipe):


<input [(ngModel)]="userInput" [ngModelOptions]="{standalone: true}" />
<p>{{ userInput | uppercase }}</p>
Summary
Pipes are a core feature in Angular for transforming data in the view.

Angular has many built-in pipes like date, currency, uppercase, and more.

You can create custom pipes by implementing the PipeTransform interface.

Pipes can accept parameters to make them flexible.

Use pure pipes for optimal performance. Only use impure pipes if necessary.

CommonModule is required for built-in pipes in non-root modules.

Overview of Angular Services
In Angular, services are a fundamental concept that allows developers to create reusable pieces of code that can be shared across different components of an application. They are primarily used to encapsulate business logic, data access, and other functionalities that can be utilized by multiple components, promoting a clean separation of concerns.
Key Features of Angular Services
Singleton Pattern: Angular services are typically designed as singletons, meaning that a single instance of a service is created and shared throughout the application. This ensures that the same instance is used whenever the service is injected into a component or another service, which is crucial for maintaining state and data consistency 
.
Dependency Injection: Angular employs a powerful dependency injection system that allows services to be easily injected into components or other services. This promotes modularity and makes it easier to manage dependencies within the application.
Separation of Concerns: By using services, developers can separate the business logic from the user interface logic. This makes the application easier to maintain and test, as services can be developed and tested independently of the components that use them 
.
Reusability: Services can be reused across multiple components, which reduces code duplication and enhances maintainability. For example, a service that handles API calls can be injected into any component that requires data from the server 
.
Creating a Service in Angular
To create a service in Angular, follow these steps:
Generate the Service: You can generate a service using the Angular CLI with the command:
javascript


ng generate service serviceName
This command creates a new service file and updates the module to include it.
Define the Service: In the generated service file, you can define methods and properties that encapsulate the desired functionality. For example:
typescript


import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root', // Makes the service available application-wide
})
export class MyService {
  constructor() {}

  getData() {
    // Logic to fetch data
  }
}
Inject the Service: To use the service in a component, you need to inject it through the component's constructor:
typescript


import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { MyService } from './my.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private myService: MyService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.myService.getData();
  }
}
Conclusion
In summary, Angular services are a powerful feature that enhances the modularity, maintainability, and testability of applications. By leveraging dependency injection and the singleton pattern, services allow developers to create reusable and encapsulated functionalities that can be shared across components, leading to cleaner and more efficient code.

📌 Quick Summary: What Goes in imports array in Angular?
✅ Put inside imports (For Angular Features):

Angular Modules (e.g., CommonModule, FormsModule, HttpClientModule)

Standalone Components (e.g., MyStandaloneComponent)

Angular Directives & Pipes (e.g., NgIf, NgFor, AsyncPipe)

❌ Do NOT put inside imports (For Normal TypeScript Classes):

Services (e.g., AuthService, UserService) – Just import normally

Interfaces & Models (e.g., User, Product) – No need to import at runtime

Utility Functions (e.g., formatDate(), calculateTotal())

🚀 Rule of Thumb: If it’s an Angular-provided feature, put it in imports. If it’s just a regular TypeScript class, import it normally!
What is Routing in Angular?
In a Single Page Application (SPA) like Angular, your whole website runs inside one HTML page (index.html). When users click links or navigate, the page doesn't reload. Instead, Angular swaps parts of the view by loading different components dynamically — this is called routing.

So, Angular routing is a system that:

✅ Matches the browser's URL (like /home, /about, etc.)
✅ Loads the correct Angular component for that route
✅ Changes views without reloading the page

📦 How Does Angular Routing Work?
Here’s the behind-the-scenes flow:

User enters a URL or clicks a link.

Angular's Router sees the URL and looks at a route configuration.

It finds a match, and loads the associated component.

The component is displayed inside the <router-outlet> tag.

🔁 Step-by-Step Routing in Angular
🔹 Step 1: Enable routing in your Angular app
If you create a new Angular project with:


ng new my-app
Angular will ask:
"Would you like to add Angular routing?" — choose Yes.

This generates a file:
📁 app-routing.module.ts — this is where you define your routes.

🔹 Step 2: Define routes (path + component)
Each route is a path in the URL that links to a component.

Example in app-routing.module.ts:


const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  { path: 'contact', component: ContactComponent },
];
💡 This means:

When the user visits / → show HomeComponent

When the user visits /about → show AboutComponent

etc.

🔹 Step 3: Load the routed component inside <router-outlet>
In app.component.html, add this:


<router-outlet></router-outlet>
That’s where routed views will be displayed.

🔹 Step 4: Add navigation with routerLink
Instead of regular <a href="">, Angular uses:


<a routerLink="/about">About Us</a>
Angular intercepts this click, updates the URL, and loads the component without reloading the page.

🔹 Step 5: Handle unknown routes (Optional)
To show a fallback page when users enter an unknown route:

{ path: '**', redirectTo: '' }
This catches all unmatched URLs.

📌 Terms to Remember
Term	Meaning
Route	A mapping of URL → Component
Router	The Angular service that manages navigation
routerLink	A directive to navigate between routes
router-outlet	The placeholder where components are loaded
Route Guard	A way to control access to routes (like authentication)
Lazy Loading	Loading modules only when needed to save load time
